🛒 Supermarket Database Management System
Welcome to the Supermarket Database Management System!
This project provides a robust relational database design to manage supermarket operations efficiently. From tracking products and inventory to managing customer orders, suppliers, employees, and payrolls, this system is designed to streamline complex processes.

🚀 Features
Comprehensive Entity Relationships
Covers Orders, Inventory, Products, Suppliers, Employees, Customers, Warehouses, Deliveries, and Payments.

Data Integrity
Ensures accurate and consistent data with well-defined constraints and foreign keys.

Scalable Design
Optimized schema with indexed columns for faster querying.

Monetary Precision
Uses DECIMAL data types for accurate financial calculations.

Detailed Query Examples
Predefined SQL queries to handle common operations like revenue calculation, order tracking, and inventory checks.

🗂️ Table Structure
Key entities and their purposes:

Orders: Tracks customer purchases and their total amount.
Products: Contains information about goods available in the supermarket.
Suppliers: Stores supplier details for efficient restocking.
Employees: Includes employee data, roles, payrolls, and more.
Warehouses: Manages inventory storage.
Payments: Logs transaction details.

📦 Getting Started
Prerequisites
MySQL or a compatible database management system installed.
SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or CLI).
Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supermarket-database.git
     cd supermarket-database
   
3. Import the database schema:
     mysql -u <username> -p < supermarket.sql
   
4. Populate with sample data:
     Run the sample_data.sql file to get started quickly.

5. Execute queries to interact with the system.

🎯 Usage
Example Queries
Get Total Revenue:
          SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalRevenue FROM Payments;

Track Order Details:
          Copy code
          SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = 1;
Check Inventory Levels:
          SELECT p.ProductName, wi.Quantity  
          FROM WarehouseInventory wi  
          JOIN Products p ON wi.ProductID = p.ProductID;
